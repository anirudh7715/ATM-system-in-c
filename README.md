## ATM

#### atm.c,balance.txt.pin.txt.account.txt

This atm program is completley written in C.
Every account in account.txt is assigned with some pin in pin.txt.There is no possibility in our program to create new accounts.We are going to use existing accounts only.
For the very first display the program asks for account number and pin.Enter correct details.You may open account.txt and pin.txt and know details of any account.After that you may perform operations on your account.The amount debited or credited will be updated in balance.txt.Every statement will be recorded in mini.txt file.I didn't upload mini statement file because after executing a transaction the text file will automatically generated.
